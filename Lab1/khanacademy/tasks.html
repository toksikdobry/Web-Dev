        Nobody’s born smart. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when <em>Einstein</em> couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until <strong>one</strong> day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        Failing is just another <strong>word</strong> for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. learning.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole <em>universe</em><br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can learn anything.

    <p>The <strong>kangaroo</strong> is a marsupial from the family Macropodidae (macropods, meaning 'large foot'). In common use the term is used to describe the largest species from this family, especially those of the genus Macropus, red kangaroo, antilopine kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo and western grey kangaroo. Kangaroos are endemic to Australia, and one genus, the tree-kangaroo, is also found in Papua New Guinea.</p>

    <p>Kangaroos have large, powerful hind legs, large feet adapted for leaping, a long muscular tail for balance, and a small head. Like most marsupials, female kangaroos have a pouch called a marsupium in which joeys complete postnatal development.</p>

    <p>Larger kangaroos have adapted much better than smaller macropods to land clearing for pastoral agriculture and habitat changes brought to the Australian landscape by humans. Many of the smaller species are rare and endangered, whilst the larger kangaroos are relatively plentiful.</p>
    
    
    <h3 id="locomotion">Locomotion</h3>
    
    <p>A Tasmanian forester (eastern grey) kangaroo in motion.
Kangaroos are the only large animals to use hopping as a means of locomotion. The comfortable hopping speed for a red kangaroo is about 20–25 km/h (13–16 mph), but speeds of up to 70 km/h (44 mph) can be attained over short distances, while it can sustain a speed of 40 km/h (25 mph) for nearly 2 km (1.2 mi). This fast and energy-efficient method of travel has evolved because of the need to regularly cover large distances in search of food and water, rather than the need to escape predators. At slow speeds, it employs pentapedal locomotion, using its tail to form a tripod with its two forelimbs while bringing its hind feet forward. Kangaroos are adept swimmers, and often flee into waterways if threatened by a predator. If pursued into the water, a kangaroo may use its forepaws to hold the predator underwater so as to drown it.</p>

    <h3 id="diet">Diet</h3>
    
    <p>Kangaroos have chambered stomachs similar to those of cattle and sheep. They regurgitate the vegetation they have eaten, chew it as cud, and then swallow it again for final digestion. Different species of kangaroos have different diets, although all are strict herbivores. The eastern grey kangaroo is predominantly a grazer, eating a wide variety of grasses, whereas some other species (e.g. the red kangaroo) include significant amounts of shrubs in their diets. The smaller species of kangaroos also consume hypogeal fungi. Many species are nocturnal, and crepuscular, usually spending the days resting in shade, and the cool evenings, nights and mornings moving about and feeding.</p>

    <p>Because of its grazing habits, the kangaroo has developed specialized teeth. Its incisors are able to crop grass close to the ground, and its molars chop and grind the grass. Since the two sides of the lower jaw are not joined together, the lower incisors are farther apart, giving the kangaroo a wider bite. The silica in grass is abrasive, so kangaroo molars move forward as they are ground down, and eventually fall out, replaced by new teeth that grow in the back. This process is known as polyphyodonty and amongst other mammals, only occurs in elephants and manatees.</p>

            <p>The <strong>ocean</strong> is the connected body of salty water that covers 70.8% of the Earth's surface. The sea moderates the Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been travelled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the sea—oceanography—dates broadly to the British Challenger expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into four or five large sections, such as the Pacific, called oceans while smaller sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as seas.
            </p>
            <p>
    Owing to the present state of continental drift, the Northern Hemisphere is now fairly equally divided between land and sea (a ratio of about 2:3) but the South is overwhelmingly oceanic (1:4.7). Salinity in the open ocean is generally in a narrow band around 3.5% by mass, although this can vary in more landlocked waters, near the mouths of large rivers, or at great depths. About 85% of the solids in the open sea are sodium and chloride. Deep-sea currents are produced by differences in salinity and temperature. Surface currents are formed by the friction of waves produced by the wind and by tides, the changes in local sea level produced by the gravity of the Moon and Sun. The direction of all of these is governed by surface and submarine land masses and by the rotation of the Earth (the Coriolis effect).

    <p>
      The <strong>kangaroo</strong> is a marsupial from the family Macropodidae
      (macropods, meaning 'large foot'). In common use the term is used to
      describe the largest species from this family, especially those of the
      genus Macropus, red kangaroo, antilopine kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo
      and western grey kangaroo. Kangaroos are endemic to Australia, and one
      genus, the tree-kangaroo, is also found in Papua New Guinea.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kangaroos have large, powerful hind legs, large feet adapted for leaping,
      a long muscular tail for balance, and a small head. Like most marsupials,
      female kangaroos have a pouch called a marsupium in which joeys complete
      postnatal development.
    </p>

    <p>
      Larger kangaroos have adapted much better than smaller macropods to land
      clearing for pastoral agriculture and habitat changes brought to the
      Australian landscape by humans. Many of the smaller species are rare and
      endangered, whilst the larger kangaroos are relatively plentiful.
    </p>

    <h3 id="locomotion">Locomotion</h3>

    <p>
      A Tasmanian forester (eastern grey) kangaroo in motion. Kangaroos are the
      only large animals to use hopping as a means of locomotion. The
      comfortable hopping speed for a red kangaroo is about 20–25 km/h (13–16
      mph), but speeds of up to 70 km/h (44 mph) can be attained over short
      distances, while it can sustain a speed of 40 km/h (25 mph) for nearly 2
      km (1.2 mi). This fast and energy-efficient method of travel has evolved
      because of the need to regularly cover large distances in search of food
      and water, rather than the need to escape predators. At slow speeds, it
      employs pentapedal locomotion, using its tail to form a tripod with its
      two forelimbs while bringing its hind feet forward. Kangaroos are adept
      swimmers, and often flee into waterways if threatened by a predator. If
      pursued into the water, a kangaroo may use its forepaws to hold the
      predator underwater so as to drown it.
    </p>

    <h3 id="diet">Diet</h3>

    <p>
      Kangaroos have chambered stomachs similar to those of cattle and sheep.
      They regurgitate the vegetation they have eaten, chew it as cud, and then
      swallow it again for final digestion. Different species of kangaroos have
      different diets, although all are strict herbivores. The eastern grey
      kangaroo is predominantly a grazer, eating a wide variety of grasses,
      whereas some other species (e.g. the red kangaroo) include significant
      amounts of shrubs in their diets. The smaller species of kangaroos also
      consume hypogeal fungi. Many species are nocturnal, and crepuscular,
      usually spending the days resting in shade, and the cool evenings, nights
      and mornings moving about and feeding.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because of its grazing habits, the kangaroo has developed specialized
      teeth. Its incisors are able to crop grass close to the ground, and its
      molars chop and grind the grass. Since the two sides of the lower jaw are
      not joined together, the lower incisors are farther apart, giving the
      kangaroo a wider bite. The silica in grass is abrasive, so kangaroo molars
      move forward as they are ground down, and eventually fall out, replaced by
      new teeth that grow in the back. This process is known as polyphyodonty
      and amongst other mammals, only occurs in elephants and manatees.

      peeled onion, and then remove it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 4:</strong> Now prepare a zirvak for Uzbek pilaf. Transfer
      the chopped onion into the heated oil and fry it while stirring for 5-7
      minutes so that it turns dark golden in color, but does not burn.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 5:</strong> Then transfer the pieces of lamb to the fried
      onion and fry them for 10-15 minutes so that the pieces become ruddy on
      all sides. Fry everything over high heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 6:</strong>Next, transfer the chopped carrots to the cauldron
      and fry it for 3 minutes without stirring. After three minutes, mix all
      the ingredients with a spatula and cook the zirvak for another 10 minutes.
      Rub the coriander and cumin in your palms or in a mortar and pour this
      mixture into a cauldron. Add dried barberry and salt to your taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 7:</strong> Fry the meat with vegetables and spices until the
      carrots are soft. Then pour boiling water into the cauldron 2 cm above the
      meat level and simmer the zirvak already on low heat for 1 hour. You can
      add hot pepper to the zirvak according to your taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 8:</strong> After an hour, lay an even layer on top of the
      washed rice. Then increase the heat to maximum and pour boiling water
      through the skimmer or along the wall of the cauldron. The water level
      should be 3 cm above the rice layer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 9:</strong> When the rice has absorbed all the liquid, press
      two garlic heads into it (only up to half), make the fire minimal and
      simmer the pilaf under a closed lid.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 10:</strong> After 10 minutes, tap on the wall of the
      cauldron with a slotted spoon, and if the sound is muffled, then in the
      pilaf make punctures to the bottom of the cauldron with a stick to remove
      steam through them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 11:</strong> Then put a flat plate on top of the rice, and
      close the cauldron with a lid. Cook the pilaf for another 20-30 minutes on
      low heat. Then remove the garlic heads, mix the pilaf and remove the
      sample. Uzbek pilaf in a cauldron is ready. You can serve it to the table.
